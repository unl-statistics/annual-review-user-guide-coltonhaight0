# Comments/suggestions

I need quite a bit more detail here to ensure that you're set up for success. Define your scope - what type of splines? Will you compare to LOWESS smooths? Is the focus on penalized spline regression, or just smoothing splines? 

"Fixing" messy data isn't something splines can do, so I'd like you to try to reframe this and resubmit so that I can help steer you on a successful completion path.
